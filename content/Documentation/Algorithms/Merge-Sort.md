## Overview

The merge sort algorithm is a quite old algorithm to solve the sorting problem but still widely used and it is a good introduction into _divide & conquer_ algorithms. With divide and conquer the problem to solve will be break down into smaller sub-problems which will solved recursively. The results of these sub-problems will be combined somehow to get a solution for the initial problem.

It is an efficient algorithm and it is an improvement over other more obvious sort algorithms like 

- Selection
- Insertion
- Bubble sort.
